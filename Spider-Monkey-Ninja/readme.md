Purpose of this website is a Marketing Tool for a business call Spider Monkey Ninja. It is a youth Ninja coarse gym that holds youth programs.

Deisgn choices came from the company I currently work for and used colors that matches the Ninja logo I found.

I used chat gpt to create most of the text.

I used w3 schools to help with the of the coading.

The challenges I faced was in the CSS. Sometimes I would think I made a change and nothing happens. So more research and trial and error in CSS.

I tried to keep everything blanced and no empty spaces. I used the gradient took to make it look a little more interesting.
